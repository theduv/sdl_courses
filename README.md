## SDL Courses (temporary name)

![Calendar Example](https://github.com/theduv/sdl_courses/blob/main/images/ExampleCalendar.png?raw=true)

SDL Courses is a website that allows our promotion at the university to centralize the notes we're taking during classes.

### How does it work ?

![Adding course example](https://github.com/theduv/sdl_courses/blob/main/images/ExampleAddCourse.png?raw=true)

It's basically presented as a calendar, on which you can add / edit / delete courses you're taking.
You can specify the teacher's name, the room, customize the color... and even add extra notes such as "canceled", or whatever you want.
The website is participatory, everyone can add an entry and edit them, which makes it rely on mutual trust.
